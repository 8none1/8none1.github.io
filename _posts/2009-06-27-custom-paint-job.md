Hereâ€™s the result of my custom paint job on my Acer Aspire One. Thanks to Tommy @ <http://www.losthoughts.com/> for the stencil.

I took the whole laptop to pieces and removed the lid from the screen so I was just left with the plastic. Then I sanded it back to bare plastic with wet&amp;dry then smoothed it off with finer grades of wet&amp;dry. Then when it was smooth I washed off all the plastic dust and let it dry before applying 3 coats of primer and about 4 coats of white paint, then one coat of black and about 4 coats of lacquer on top. It took an entire weekend. I also painted the bezel around the screen inside white.
