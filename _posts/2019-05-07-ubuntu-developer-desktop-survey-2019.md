It’s clear that a lot of people develop software using Ubuntu. What’s less clear is exactly what sort of software is being built. We see reports of people developing Linux apps, Android apps, web services, self driving cars… the list is huge. We need to get better clarity; to understand how that relates to Ubuntu desktop.

We can get some reasonable insights from the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), but I’m keen to really dig down in to the Ubuntu community specifically.

When I was chatting with [Barton George](https://bartongeorge.io/) a few weeks back he expressed the same interest; what *are* people doing with the [Sputnik](https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/555/campaigns/xps-linux-laptop_us) machines from Dell? We want to learn more about the sorts of software projects that you’re working on so that we can make the Ubuntu developer experience as good as possible.

To that end we put together the [Ubuntu Developer Desktop Survey](http://desktopdevelopersurvey2019.ubuntu.com/) to help us understand more about what you’re doing and how you’re doing it. This survey is aimed primarily at people who are using Ubuntu to develop software targeting any platform. It doesn’t matter if you do that at work, at home, at school – if you’re building software then we’re glad to hear from you. To be clear: this doesn’t mean we’re abandoning our mantra of Ubuntu being for human beings, software developers are human beings too. Right now I want to get a better view in to what software developers are doing.

The survey will close on Friday 31st May 2019 and we will publish the results very shortly afterwards. We’ll then follow that up with some further analysis and some ideas as to how this will influence the desktop product roadmap in the future. Please take this opportunity to help shape Ubuntu for the better.
