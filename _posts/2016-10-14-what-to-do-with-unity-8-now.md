As you’re probably aware Ubuntu 16.10 was released yesterday and brings with it the Unity 8 desktop session as a preview of what’s being worked on right now and a reflection of the current state of play.

You might have already logged in and kicked the proverbial tyres. If not I would urge you to do so. Please take the time to install a couple of apps as laid out here:

<http://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/10/13/unity-8-preview-session-in-ubuntu-16-10-yakkety-yak/>

The main driver for getting Unity 8 in to 16.10 was the chance to get it in the hands of users so we can get feedback and bug reports. If you find something doesn’t work, please, log a bug. We don’t monitor every forum or comments section on the web so the absolute best way to provide your feedback to people who can act on it is a bug report with clear steps on how to reproduce the issue (in the case of crashes) or an explanation of why you think a particular behaviour is wrong. This is how you get things changed or fixed.

You can contribute to Ubuntu by simply playing with it.
