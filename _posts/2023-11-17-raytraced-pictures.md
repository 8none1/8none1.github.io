# Finally the wireframe city

Over four years ago [Stuart wrote about](https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2019/04/01/the-ray-traced-pictures/) a twenty year search to track down an old sound sample from the Acorn Archimedes.

And today, 20 years two months and one week after this search began, the final (?) chapter of this story is over.  A demo appeared on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR98lmARCAo) which shows a demo made for Clares by David Hoskins in 1988.  This demo is the original source of the sample.

There is a very high likelihood that this tale means something to only three people in all of the history of mankind.

Without further ado, here is *THE* ray traced pictures, *THE* mask, and *THE* wireframe city that were being talked about all this time and which were totally unknown by either of us until today.
