In a post on the Google Geo Developers Blog, Mickey Kataria, Product Manager of something – Google Maps I’m guessing, announced Google Maps API version 3. It will move away from the G…. name space and to the google…… name space.

What does this mean for you? Not a lot probably. I expect that version 3 will still be a long time coming and that version 2 will be around for a while. Still, it might be worth starting to move your code over to the google name space and the Google loader.

There are a raft of new features, most interesting to me is the improved support for mobile browsers.

Anyway, check out the post here: <http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2009/05/announcing-google-maps-api-v3.html>

and the new version 3 API reference: <http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/v3/reference.html>
