In order to remind myself:

I kept getting this error when trying to send an SMS;

No call scheduled as already sending

It seems SMSq or Asterisk is quite picky about who sends the SMS. If I tired to send an SMS as myself it would fail, and then clog up /var/spool/asterisk/sms/motx with undead SMSes.

If I run smsq as the same user as Asterisk is running as it works (once youâ€™ve deleted all the crap out of motx directory.

Just need to work out why now.
