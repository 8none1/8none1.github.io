*In which one Raspberry Pi is seen.*

In [part one of this series](http://www.whizzy.org/2014/01/raspberry-pi-powered-heating-controller-part-1/ "Raspberry Pi powered heating controller (Part 1)") I explained how the central heating system was wired up and what electrical connections you needed to make to switch your heating and hot water on and off.

I ordered all the parts and now I’ve plugged them all together. Here’s a quick video demonstrating how it will all work.
