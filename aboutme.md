I'm Will Cooke.

I like computers.

I work at [InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com) as the director of engineering for the storage engine and write-path.

I used to work at [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com) as the director of Ubuntu Desktop.  I still use Ubuntu all day every day.

I'm part of the [Late Night Linux](https://latenightlinux.com) podcast team.  We put out a weekly podcast about Linux, free software and general hatred of the Tory party.

My amateur radio callsign is M7WZY.

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/8none1).

I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/8none1).

I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-cooke-64b69417/).

I'm on [Telegram](https://t.me/willcooke).

I also like home automation, plumbing, electrics and electronics, golf, craft beer, chicken wings and looking at graphs.
